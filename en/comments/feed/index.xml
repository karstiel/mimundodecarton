		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] Some time ago I was used bondage trousers all days with boots or platform shoes, but I stopped to use them and now, when I wanted to use them again I saw that it didn&#8217;t fit me and that was the reason why I decided to buy one new. My favourite bondage trouser brand was Tripp, but I found another ones which I liked so much and also they had good prize. They are from Poizen Industries brand and the shop is Kinkyangel. Also I have bought two black short dresses, one of them which I wanted it since one year ago (I have it!). I have put a photo (the first) in my post about daily Summer dresses.
